|CVE-2020-5427|In Spring Cloud Data Flow, versions 2.6.x prior to 2.6.5, versions 2.5.x prior 2.5.4, an application is vulnerable to SQL injection when requesting task execution.|Spring Cloud Data Flow|2.6.5|
|CVE-2020-5428|In applications using Spring Cloud Task 2.2.4.RELEASE and below, may be vulnerable to SQL injection when exercising certain lookup queries in the TaskExplorer.|Spring Cloud Task|2.2.5|
|CVE-2021-37694|@asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template generates a Spring Cloud Stream (SCSt) microservice. In versions prior to 0.7.0 arbitrary code injection was possible when an attacker controls the AsyncAPI document. An example is provided in GHSA-xj6r-2jpm-qvxp. There are no mitigations available and all users are advised to update.|java-spring-cloud-stream-template|< 0.7.0|
|CVE-2021-22053|Applications using both `spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard` and `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf` expose a way to execute code submitted within the request URI path during the resolution of view templates. When a request is made at `/hystrix/monitor;[user-provided data]`, the path elements following `hystrix/monitor` are being evaluated as SpringEL expressions, which can lead to code execution.|Spring Cloud Netflix|Spring Cloud Netflix versions 2.2.x prior to 2.2.10.Release + and old unsupported versions|
|CVE-2021-39181|OpenOlat is a web-based learning management system (LMS). Prior to version 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0, using a prepared import XML file (e.g. a course) any class on the Java classpath can be instantiated, including spring AOP bean factories. This can be used to execute code arbitrary code by the attacker. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account with the authoring role. It can not be exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions 15.3.18, 15.5.3, and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.|OpenOLAT|< 15.3.18|
|CVE-2022-24815|JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop, & deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures. SQL Injection vulnerability in entities for applications generated with the option "reactive with Spring WebFlux" enabled and an SQL database using r2dbc. Applications created without "reactive with Spring WebFlux" and applications with NoSQL databases are not affected. Users who have generated a microservice Gateway using the affected version may be impacted as Gateways are reactive by default. Currently, SQL injection is possible in the findAllBy(Pageable pageable, Criteria criteria) method of an entity repository class generated in these applications as the where clause using Criteria for queries are not sanitized and user input is passed on as it is by the criteria. This issue has been patched in v7.8.1. Users unable to upgrade should be careful when combining criterias and conditions as the root of the issue lies in the `EntityManager.java` class when creating the where clause via `Conditions.just(criteria.toString())`. `just` accepts the literal string provided. Criteria's `toString` method returns a plain string and this combination is vulnerable to sql injection as the string is not sanitized and will contain whatever used passed as input using any plain SQL.|generator-jhipster|>= 7.0.0, < 7.8.1|
|CVE-2022-46166|Spring boot admins is an open source administrative user interface for management of spring boot applications. All users who run Spring Boot Admin Server, having enabled Notifiers (e.g. Teams-Notifier) and write access to environment variables via UI are affected. Users are advised to upgrade to the most recent releases of Spring Boot Admin 2.6.10 and 2.7.8 to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may disable any notifier or disable write access (POST request) on `/env` actuator endpoint.|spring-boot-admin|< 2.6.10|
|CVE-2022-23463|Nepxion Discovery is a solution for Spring Cloud. Discover is vulnerable to SpEL Injection in discovery-commons. DiscoveryExpressionResolverâ€™s eval method is evaluating expression with a StandardEvaluationContext, allowing the expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as java.lang.Runtime, leading to Remote Code Execution. There is no patch available for this issue at time of publication. There are no known workarounds.|Discover|6.16.2|
|CVE-2022-22947|In spring cloud gateway versions prior to 3.1.1+ and 3.0.7+ , applications are vulnerable to a code injection attack when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed and unsecured. A remote attacker could make a maliciously crafted request that could allow arbitrary remote execution on the remote host.|Spring Cloud Gateway|Spring cloud gateway versions 3.1.x prior to 3.1.1+, 3.0.x prior to 3.0.7+ and all old and unsupported versions|
|CVE-2022-22965|A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.|Spring Framework|Spring Framework versions 5.3.X prior to 5.3.18+, 5.2.x prior to 5.2.20+ and all old and unsupported versions|
|CVE-2022-22980|A Spring Data MongoDB application is vulnerable to SpEL Injection when using @Query or @Aggregation-annotated query methods with SpEL expressions that contain query parameter placeholders for value binding if the input is not sanitized.|Spring Data MongoDB|3.4.0, 3.3.0 to 3.3.4 and Older|
|CVE-2022-22963|In Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and older unsupported versions, when using routing functionality it is possible for a user to provide a specially crafted SpEL as a routing-expression that may result in remote code execution and access to local resources.|Spring Cloud Function|Spring  Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and all old and unsupported versions|
|CVE-2022-4282|A vulnerability was found in SpringBootCMS and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is some unknown functionality of the component Template Management. The manipulation leads to injection. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. VDB-214790 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability.|SpringBootCMS|n/a|
