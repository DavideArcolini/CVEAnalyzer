The project consists of searching and studying some of the CVE vulnerabilities that affect open-source Java web applications and/or REST APIs. More precisely, some criterions will be defined to identify a collection of relevant CVE entries. Then, for each identified CVE, the affected software will be tested with static source code analysis tools to locate the vulnerability described by the CVE, and a simplified code sample will be built for teaching purposes starting from the vulnerable code.
